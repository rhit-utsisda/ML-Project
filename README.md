# March Madness Predictions

## About
This repository contains a `Project` folder that contains various Machine Learning Algorithms used to make predictions on the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball March Madness Tournament. There are a total of 7 code files: <br>
1. `AllRegressions.ipynb` <br>
This file performs a grid search with cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and run regressions for Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosted Trees to predict wins for each tournament team in 2024.
2. `DTREE KEN.ipynb` <br>
3. `DtreewTrap.ipynb` <br>
4. `LinRegWins.ipynb` <br>
This file contains a Linear Regression aimed toward predicting wins for each tournament team in 2024 along with some observations of the results.
5. `RForest_Ranks.ipynb` <br>
6. `rfrgbt.ipynb` <br>
7. `StatBasedFeatureEngSelectionLinearization.ipynb` <br>
The file performs feature selection for all 2nd degree terms.

There is also one dataset in the main `Project` directory, while the rest exist in the `/Project/Datasets` folder. The base datasets came from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nishaanamin/march-madness-data](url).
